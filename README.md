# Small tansformer 
This is a small trasformer model that i am learning with help from @AndrejKarpathy on youtube
## what does it do ? 
the model will yap in a william shakespear tone or any other author given the enough data , the results wont make sense the model will simply mimics the writting style , i rarly found anything of meaning while testing the code , but its still plain old english
## runing it ?
- install the pytorch ```pip install torch```
- run the script (fair worning , this is a larg model and i wouldnt recommend runing it on a cpu plus it will take take min of 15min , i run it on a moderate gpu and it took 50min)
